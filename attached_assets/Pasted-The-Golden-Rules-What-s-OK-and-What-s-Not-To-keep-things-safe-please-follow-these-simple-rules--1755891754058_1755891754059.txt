The Golden Rules: What's OK and What's Not
To keep things safe, please follow these simple rules.
✅ What You Should Do
Follow Security Process: Replit Prototype Apps Deployment Plan
Use Fake Data Only: Your prototype must only use completely fabricated data. Think fake names, made-up email addresses (user1@example.com), and imaginary numbers.
Focus on UI/UX: Concentrate on demonstrating the user interface (how it looks) and the user experience (how it feels to navigate).
Keep it Simple: Build just enough to get your idea across.
Auto-expiry
 Prototypes must expire in 15 days or get reviewed for renewal.
Internal registry
Update the internal registry (Replit Prototype Inventory) of active prototypes, owners, purpose, and expiry date.
❌ What You Must NEVER Do
No Real Customer Data: Never use any real customer information. This includes, but is not limited to:
Names, email addresses, phone numbers
Aadhaar numbers, PAN cards
Bank account numbers, credit/debit card info
Usernames or passwords
No Company Secrets/internal data: Never put 
internal credentials like API keys, passwords, or access tokens into your prototype's code.
Company internal data - email, phone numbers, employee IDs, BU/team names etc
No Real Connections: Never connect your prototype to any of the company's internal systems, databases, or APIs. The prototype must be completely standalone.
No Real Transactions: The prototype cannot perform any real financial transactions or move actual money.
No assumption that this can be “promoted to production”
No storing or processing of any real data
Restrict sharing the links to over public channels
The most critical risk is a data leak. Using a prototype as a stepping stone to a full application without a security review is a major bypass of our development process. Any prototype found violating these rules will be taken down immediately.
How to Share Prototypes Safely
When your prototype is ready for feedback, you need to share it in a controlled way.
Add a Disclaimer: Place a clear, visible banner or pop-up on your prototype that says:
"This is a non-functional design prototype for demonstration only. Please do not enter any real personal or financial information."
Share Directly: Send the Razorpay prototype link (Do Not Share the Replit link) directly to a specific, limited group of trusted customers you are engaging for feedback. Avoid posting the link on public forums or social media. Securely share the secret to access the link
Time-box Access: Prototypes should be considered temporary. Plan to take them down or archive them after your feedback cycle is complete (e.g., within 15-30 days).
Basic Safety Checks
Before you share any prototype, run through this quick checklist. 🛡️
The "No Real Data" Pledge: Confirm on the Security Ticket that your prototype contains zero real customer or company data.
Peer Review: Ask another Product Manager / Peer to quickly review your prototype. A fresh pair of eyes can spot if it accidentally asks for sensitive information or looks too much like a real, live application.
Clear Naming: All prototype projects in Replit must be named with a proto- prefix. For example: proto-new-dashboard-v1. This helps us identify and track all prototypes.
🔹 Basic Security Checklist for Prototypes
Even in a fast-track setup, some basic controls must be followed:
✅ Check
Description
🔒 No secrets
No hardcoded tokens, keys, credentials
🧪 Fake data only
Use dummy/fake data — never customer or org data
📶 No integrations
Don’t connect to any razorpay assets
🚫 No storage
Don’t store form data, uploads, or cookies
📛 Clear labeling
UI must state clearly “Prototype Only”
⏳ Auto-expiry
Should be removed/reviewed every 15 days


Clear DB every week
🗃️ Registry
All prototypes logged with owner/contact/review info
